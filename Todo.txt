to do:

- Feature Extraction --> how do we want to best encode information about the price
 and the quality of wine
- When we start off we ask the user for the amount of wines that we  are clustering
 by --> is there a more efficient way to do this
 - What kind of optimization do we want to use?
 - Are we doing any sort of regularization?
 - How do we want to interact and get responses back from the user?
